## Technical Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Chart of Accounts System

**Implementation Details:**
```cpp
class EnhancedChartOfAccounts {
public:
    // Hierarchical account management
    bool addAccount(const Account& account);
    bool removeAccount(const std::string& accountCode);
    Account* getAccount(const std::string& accountCode);
    std::vector<Account> getAccountHierarchy(const std::string& rootCode);
    
    // Multi-currency support
    bool addCurrency(const Currency& currency);
    bool setExchangeRate(const std::string& from, const std::string& to, double rate);
    Money convertCurrency(const Money& amount, const std::string& targetCurrency);
    
    // Account templates
    bool loadAccountTemplate(const std::string& templateName);
    bool saveAccountTemplate(const std::string& templateName);
    
    // Metadata management
    bool setAccountMetadata(const std::string& accountCode, const Metadata& metadata);
    Metadata getAccountMetadata(const std::string& accountCode);
    
private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Account> accounts_;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Currency> currencies_;
    ExchangeRateManager exchangeRateManager_;
    MetadataStore metadataStore_;
};
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Accounts table with hierarchical support
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_code VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    account_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    account_type ENUM('ASSET', 'LIABILITY', 'EQUITY', 'REVENUE', 'EXPENSE'),
    parent_account_code VARCHAR(50),
    currency_code VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_account_code) REFERENCES accounts(account_code),
    INDEX idx_parent_account (parent_account_code),
    INDEX idx_account_type (account_type)
);

-- Account metadata for custom fields
CREATE TABLE account_metadata (
    account_code VARCHAR(50),
    metadata_key VARCHAR(100),
    metadata_value TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (account_code, metadata_key),
    FOREIGN KEY (account_code) REFERENCES accounts(account_code)
);
```

### 2. Advanced Transaction Engine

**Transaction Processing Architecture:**
```cpp
class TransactionEngine {
public:
    // Single transaction processing
    TransactionResult processTransaction(const Transaction& transaction);
    
    // Batch processing
    BatchTransactionResult processBatch(const std::vector<Transaction>& transactions);
    
    // Template and recurring transactions
    bool createTransactionTemplate(const TransactionTemplate& template);
    bool scheduleRecurringTransaction(const RecurringTransaction& recurring);
    
    // Audit and validation
    bool validateTransaction(const Transaction& transaction);
    std::string getTransactionAuditTrail(const std::string& transactionId);
    
private:
    ValidationEngine validationEngine_;
    AuditTrailManager auditTrailManager_;
    ThreadPool processingThreadPool_;
    LockFreeQueue<Transaction> transactionQueue_;
};

// High-performance transaction structure
struct Transaction {
    std::string transactionId;
    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point timestamp;
    std::string description;
    std::vector<TransactionEntry> entries;
    TransactionStatus status;
    std::string cryptographicHash;
    std::string digitalSignature;
};
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Lock-free queues for transaction processing
- SIMD vectorization for balance calculations
- Memory pool allocation for transaction objects
- Batch processing with GGML tensor operations
- Write-ahead logging for durability

### 3. Real-time Financial Reporting

**Reporting Engine Design:**
```cpp
class ReportingEngine {
public:
    // Standard financial reports
    BalanceSheet generateBalanceSheet(const ReportParameters& params);
    IncomeStatement generateIncomeStatement(const ReportParameters& params);
    CashFlowStatement generateCashFlowStatement(const ReportParameters& params);
    
    // Custom reports with formula engine
    CustomReport generateCustomReport(const ReportDefinition& definition);
    
    // Real-time subscriptions
    SubscriptionId subscribeToReport(const ReportDefinition& definition, 
                                   const std::function<void(const Report&)>& callback);
    void unsubscribeFromReport(SubscriptionId subscriptionId);
    
    // Report caching and optimization
    void enableReportCaching(bool enable);
    void precomputeReports(const std::vector<ReportDefinition>& definitions);
    
private:
    FormulaEngine formulaEngine_;
    ReportCache reportCache_;
    SubscriptionManager subscriptionManager_;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, CompiledFormula> compiledFormulas_;
};
```

**Real-time Architecture:**
- Event-driven report updates
- Incremental computation for large datasets
- Redis-based caching layer
- WebSocket streaming for live updates
- GGML acceleration for complex calculations

### 4. Data Persistence & Recovery

**Database Architecture:**
- Primary: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- Cache: Redis Cluster for real-time data and session management
- Archive: Object storage (S3/MinIO) for historical data and backups
- Search: Elasticsearch for audit log searching and analytics

**Backup and Recovery Strategy:**
```cpp
class DataPersistenceManager {
public:
    // Backup operations
    BackupResult createFullBackup(const BackupConfiguration& config);
    BackupResult createIncrementalBackup(const BackupConfiguration& config);
    
    // Recovery operations
    RecoveryResult restoreFromBackup(const BackupMetadata& backup);
    RecoveryResult performPointInTimeRecovery(const std::chrono::time_point& targetTime);
    
    // High availability
    bool enableContinuousReplication(const ReplicationConfig& config);
    ReplicationStatus getReplicationStatus();
    
    // Data validation
    ValidationResult validateDataIntegrity();
    ValidationResult validateBackupIntegrity(const BackupMetadata& backup);
    
private:
    DatabaseManager primaryDatabase_;
    DatabaseManager replicaDatabase_;
    BackupManager backupManager_;
    ReplicationManager replicationManager_;
};
```
